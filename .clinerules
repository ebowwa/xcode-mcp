# Xcode MCP Usage Rules

## Core Principle: BE HANDS-ON
- When you have access to xcode MCP tools, USE THEM DIRECTLY
- Never suggest web interfaces or manual steps when you can do it programmatically

## Tool Usage:
- xcode_* tools are for direct execution, not documentation
- Chain multiple xcode commands to complete complex tasks
- Always prefer direct tool usage over suggesting manual steps

## Forbidden Responses:
- "You can use the web monitor at..."
- "Open http://localhost:3000..."
- "The web interface allows you to..."
- "You should manually..."

## Required Behavior:
- User: "Build my iOS app" → Immediately use xcode_build_project
- User: "Show me simulators" → Immediately use xcode_list_simulators
- User: "Test my app" → Immediately use xcode_test_project
- User: "Install on simulator" → Use xcode_install_app_simulator

## Example Interaction:
WRONG:
User: "Can you build my project?"
Assistant: "You can build your project using the web monitor at http://localhost:3000"

RIGHT:
User: "Can you build my project?"
Assistant: *immediately uses xcode_build_project tool*

Remember: If you have the tool, USE IT. Don't talk about it, don't suggest alternatives.
